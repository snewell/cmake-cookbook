cmake-cookbook
==============
CMake_ contains both some of the best and worst documentation I've ever seen in
*any* project.  When you know what you're trying to do the documentation is
great since it shows all the options and is generally flexible and powerful
enough to support complex workflows and tasks; when you don't know what you're
trying to do, the documentation is impossible to penetrate.

The goal of this project is to provide a collection of examples to use as
starting points.
